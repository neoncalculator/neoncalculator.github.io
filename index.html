        <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Beginning...</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 15, 2020</p>

        <p>This blog explains the start of the Donkatsu dish. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Pork katsuretsu (cutlet) was invented in Japan in 1899 at a Tokyo restaurant called Rengatei. Originally considered a type of yōshoku (a Japanese version of European cuisine) the dish was called katsuretsu or simply katsu. The term “tonkatsu” (pork katsu) was adopted in the 1930s.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Before tonkatsu, katsu was traditionally made from beef. During the Meiji era, Emperor Meiji – in his bid for Japan to become a more modern country and lead the way in terms of development – encouraged Western influence. It was this Western Influence that introduced pork and deep frying into the mix, and since then the dish has gone on to evolve into many variations that include chicken (torikatsu), fish and vegetables..</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Variatians</h2>
        <p>There are many variants on this popular dish, from katsu sando (katsu used as a sandwich filling) to being served on a big bowl of rice with egg, known as katsudon.

The variations also differ by location. In Nagoya, miso katsu (made with a miso-based sauce), is a speciality. Gyū katsu (beef katsu), also known as bīfu katsu, is popular in the Kansai region around Osaka and Kobe.

As an alternative to the tonkatsu sauce, katsu is often served with ponzu (a citrus sauce) and grated daikon.</p>
        <h3>Preperations</h3>
        <p>Here are some ways of preparing your own delicious dish of Donkatsu!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Either a pork fillet (ヒレ, hire) or pork loin (ロース, rōsu) cut may be used; the meat is usually salted, peppered, dredged lightly in flour, dipped into beaten egg and then coated with panko (bread crumbs) before being deep fried.</li>
          <li>Tonkatsu is generally served with shredded cabbage.[6] It is most commonly eaten with a type of thick brown sauce called tonkatsu sauce or simply sōsu (sauce), karashi (mustard), and perhaps a slice of lemon. It is usually served with rice, miso soup and tsukemono and eaten with chopsticks. It may also be served with ponzu and grated daikon instead of tonkatsu sauce.</li>
          <li>In addition to being served as a single dish, it is used as a sandwich filling or in combination with curry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Iconic Katsu Curry</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">May 20, 2020</p>

        <p>Curry was introduced to Japan by the British in the Meiji era and is considered to be a Western cuisine. This Western-style curry differs from the Indian-style curry, which is also popular (the presence of Indian restaurants in Japan saw a big increase in the 1990s).</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Western-style curry sauce is made by frying together curry powder, flour and oil to make a roux. The roux is then added to stewed meat and vegetables and simmered until thickened.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Japanese homes, curry sauce is usually made from instant curry roux, in either block or powder form. This pre-made roux contains curry powder, oils, flour and a variety of flavourings.</p>
        <p>Due to the ease of preparation, curry has become a very popular dish: you can even buy pre-made curry in vacuum-sealed bags that can be reheated in boiling water (similar to the boil-in-the-bag curries that you can get in the UK). In 2007 curry sauce was the largest single category of vacuum-sealed foods in Japan, making up over 30% of sales.</p>
        <p>The pairing of katsu with curry is a great match and due to the ease of preparation and its extensive availability in Japanese restaurants and homes it is a firm favourite with the nation. The popularity of this Japanese dish is not exclusive to Japan though: in Hawaii, torikatsu is a very popular dish and is quite often served as one of the mixed plate lunch meals that are very popular across the state.</p>
